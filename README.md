# TodoApp

This is a sample app that demonstrates the use of LiveState to create embeddable web apps that communicate with a Phoenix backend.

## Getting Started
To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
